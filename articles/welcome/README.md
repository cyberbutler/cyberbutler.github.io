## Why I built this site
My plan throughout my career is to share my knowledge and what I learn here. I've built this website in the hopes that it can help me become more involved in the community.

Really, this site is the first stepping stone to sharing many more projects down the line. I hope that I can make a contribution in this awesome community as I am constantly amazed at what it has done. Consider this my first official project. I look forward to its future

I am relatively new to the security field. A few things about me:
- I started my career in cyber security as a CSOC Analyst where I quickly discovered a passion for process automation.
- After a few years on a CSOC DevOps team, I discovered a new passion for hacking and penetration testing.
- I have recently started in my first Red Team position.
